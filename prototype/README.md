# Prototype Instructions: Video Processing Application

## Objective
The goal of this prototype is to create a Node.js application that allows for the following functionalities:
- Upload videos to a server.
- Process uploaded videos into two resolutions using FFmpeg.
- Store metadata and thumbnail locations in a MySQL database.
- Stream processed videos using an HTML5 video player.

## Prerequisites

### Tools and Technologies
- **Node.js**: For building the backend application.
- **FFmpeg**: For video processing.
- **MySQL**: To store video metadata and thumbnail locations.
- **HTML5**: To build the video playback interface.

### System Requirements
- A local development machine with sufficient storage and processing power.
- Node.js installed (version 14 or higher recommended).
- FFmpeg installed and accessible via the command line.
- MySQL database server installed and running.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Setting Up the Node.js Environment
1. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```
   mkdir video-processing-app
   cd video-processing-app
   npm init -y
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install express multer mysql2 ffmpeg-static fluent-ffmpeg
   ```
   - **Express**: Web framework for creating the backend.
   - **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
   - **mysql2**: Library to interact with the MySQL database.
   - **ffmpeg-static**: Provides a static FFmpeg binary.
   - **fluent-ffmpeg**: Simplifies FFmpeg commands in Node.js.

### Step 2: Setting Up the MySQL Database
1. Create a new MySQL database named `video_app`.
2. Create a table for storing video metadata:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE videos (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       description TEXT,
       original_file_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       processed_file_path_1 VARCHAR(255),
       processed_file_path_2 VARCHAR(255),
       thumbnail_path VARCHAR(255),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```
3. Note the database credentials (host, user, password) for integration into the Node.js app.

### Step 3: Building the Upload and Processing Logic
1. **Upload Endpoint**:
   - Use `Multer` to handle video file uploads.
   - Save the uploaded file in a local directory.
2. **Processing with FFmpeg**:
   - Trigger FFmpeg to create two processed versions of the uploaded video (e.g., 480p and 720p).
   - Generate a thumbnail for the video.
   - Save the processed files and thumbnail in appropriate directories.
3. **Database Integration**:
   - Insert video metadata (title, description, file paths, etc.) into the MySQL database.

---

### Step 4: Creating the HTML5 Video Playback Interface
1. Build a simple HTML page to list and play videos:
   - Fetch video metadata from the database via a Node.js API endpoint.
   - Display a list of videos with their titles, thumbnails, and descriptions.
   - Embed an HTML5 `<video>` element for playback.
2. Include playback controls and resolution switching options.

---

## Key Considerations

### Error Handling
- Validate file types and sizes during upload.
- Handle FFmpeg processing errors gracefully.
- Implement retries for database operations in case of connection issues.

### Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection.
- Limit file upload sizes to prevent server overload.
- Use environment variables for storing sensitive data (e.g., database credentials).

### Optimization
- Use worker threads or a job queue (e.g., Bull or Bee-Queue) to handle video processing asynchronously.
- Compress processed video files to save storage space.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for additional video resolutions and formats.
- Enable user authentication to secure the upload and playback processes.
- Introduce adaptive bitrate streaming for a smoother viewing experience.

## Conclusion
This prototype outlines the foundational steps to create a video processing and streaming application. It can be expanded and refined based on specific use cases, such as supporting live streaming or integrating with cloud storage solutions.
