# Business Requirement Document (BRD): Distribution Component for Family Streaming Service

## Executive Summary
This BRD focuses on the **distribution component** of a private family streaming service. The purpose of this component is to provide an intuitive, Netflix-like user interface for consuming and interacting with uploaded video content. This document outlines the key requirements, functionality, and technical considerations necessary to build an effective distribution platform.

The scope of this document excludes the upload and storage components, which are addressed separately. The distribution system assumes that the video content has already been uploaded, processed, and stored in the required formats.

## Business Objectives
The distribution component will:
1. Provide a user-friendly web interface for browsing and streaming videos.
2. Offer seamless playback of video content across devices and network conditions.
3. Enable user interaction with videos through a commenting system.
4. Ensure secure access to private family content.

This component aims to centralize and simplify the consumption of family videos while maintaining privacy and ease of use.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Video Catalog Browsing
- **Feature:** Display all available videos in a visually appealing interface.
  - Events will be organized as "series."
  - Individual videos will be displayed as "movies."
  - Thumbnails will be used for quick identification of videos.
- **User Actions:**
  - Browse by categories (e.g., events, dates, tags).
  - Search for videos using keywords.
  - Filter by event type, upload date, or contributor.

### 2. Video Playback
- **Feature:** Stream videos in adaptive formats (e.g., HLS or DASH) to ensure smooth playback across varying network conditions.
  - Auto-select the appropriate resolution based on the userâ€™s connection.
- **User Actions:**
  - Play/pause video.
  - Adjust volume.
  - Enable fullscreen mode.
- **Considerations:** Ensure videos are streamed securely with encryption.

### 3. Commenting System
- **Feature:** Allow users to leave comments on individual videos.
  - Comments will be displayed in chronological order.
- **User Actions:**
  - Add, edit, or delete their own comments.
  - View comments from other family members.
  - Report inappropriate comments for review.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
- **Feature:** Secure access to the platform with role-based permissions.
  - Roles: Viewer, Contributor, Administrator.
- **User Actions:**
  - Log in using a secure authentication method (e.g., email and password, OAuth).
  - Reset password if necessary.
  - Only authorized users can access private videos.

### 5. Responsiveness and Device Compatibility
- **Feature:** Ensure the platform works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **User Actions:**
  - Access the platform via a web browser on any device.
  - Use the same features across all device types.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Videos should load and start playback within 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- The platform should handle concurrent access from multiple users without noticeable latency.

### 2. Scalability
- The system should support additional features in the future (e.g., AI-based recommendations).
- The platform should be able to scale with an increasing number of users and videos.

### 3. Security
- All video content must be delivered over HTTPS.
- Comments and user data must be securely stored and encrypted.
- Implement protections against common threats like SQL injection, XSS, and DDoS attacks.

### 4. Usability
- The UI should be intuitive and require minimal training for users to navigate.
- Include tooltips and help sections for first-time users.

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Frontend Technology
- **Suggested Frameworks:**
  - React.js or Vue.js for a dynamic, responsive user interface.
  - Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for consistent styling.

### 2. Backend Technology
- **Suggested Frameworks:**
  - Node.js with Express for handling API requests.
  - Django or Flask (Python) as an alternative backend.
- **Key Features:**
  - Serve video content using a CDN (e.g., AWS CloudFront, Cloudflare).
  - Provide REST or GraphQL APIs for frontend integration.

### 3. Database
- **Database Type:** Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for user data, comments, and video metadata.
- **Caching:** Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.

### 4. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Use a CDN for fast and reliable delivery of video content.
  - Recommended: AWS CloudFront, Akamai, or Cloudflare.

### 5. Video Playback
- Use a library like Video.js or Shaka Player for streaming playback.
- Ensure adaptive bitrate streaming to optimize playback quality.

## Risks and Mitigations

### 1. **Risk:** High bandwidth usage due to streaming.
   - **Mitigation:** Use a CDN to reduce server load and improve delivery speed.

### 2. **Risk:** Unauthorized access to private videos.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication measures and encrypt video URLs.

### 3. **Risk:** Poor playback experience on slower networks.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement adaptive bitrate streaming and optimize video encoding.

### 4. **Risk:** Comment abuse (e.g., spam or inappropriate messages).
   - **Mitigation:** Allow users to report comments and enable administrators to moderate them.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Mobile App:** Develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android.
2. **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Suggest videos based on user preferences and viewing history.
3. **Live Streaming:** Add support for live video streams during family events.
4. **Offline Viewing:** Allow users to download videos for offline playback.
