# Business Requirement Document (BRD): Storage for Family Streaming Service

## Introduction

This document outlines the business and technical requirements for the **storage** component of a family streaming service. The storage system will be responsible for saving original and processed video files efficiently and cost-effectively. Key considerations include scalability, lifecycle policies to manage storage costs, and ensuring availability for streaming.

## Business Objectives

The storage system must:

1. **Ensure Reliability**: Videos must be securely stored with no risk of data loss.
2. **Optimize Costs**: Implement lifecycle policies to reduce storage expenses as the video library grows.
3. **Support Scalability**: Handle increasing amounts of data as family members upload more videos.
4. **Enable Fast Access**: Ensure processed videos are available for quick streaming.
5. **Separate Concerns**: Store raw uploads and processed files in distinct tiers, optimizing storage types for each use case.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Raw Video Storage:**
   - Store the original, unprocessed videos uploaded by users.
   - Use cold storage to minimize costs since raw files are rarely accessed after processing.

2. **Processed Video Storage:**
   - Store transcoded videos in multiple resolutions (e.g., 320p, 480p, 720p).
   - Use hot storage for high availability and quick access for streaming.

3. **Lifecycle Management:**
   - Implement automatic migration of old or infrequently accessed files to cheaper storage tiers.
   - Provide configurable lifecycle rules, such as retention periods for active storage.

4. **Access and Permissions:**
   - Enforce strict authentication and authorization policies to protect private videos.
   - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) for managing permissions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability:**
   - The system should support hundreds of terabytes of data with seamless scaling.
2. **Availability:**
   - Ensure 99.9% availability for processed files stored in hot storage.
3. **Durability:**
   - Use storage solutions with 11 nines (99.999999999%) durability for both raw and processed files.
4. **Performance:**
   - Processed files must be accessible within milliseconds for streaming requests.

## Technical Specifications

### Storage Tiers

1. **Cold Storage:**
   - **Purpose:** Store raw video uploads.
   - **Service Options:**
     - AWS S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive
     - Backblaze B2
   - **Access Frequency:** Infrequent (only needed for reprocessing or archival purposes).
   - **Cost Optimization:** Lower cost per GB compared to hot storage.

2. **Hot Storage:**
   - **Purpose:** Store processed video files for active streaming.
   - **Service Options:**
     - AWS S3 Standard with CloudFront
     - DigitalOcean Spaces
   - **Access Frequency:** Frequent (active streaming).
   - **Performance Requirements:** Low latency and high throughput.

### Lifecycle Policies

1. **Raw Video Lifecycle:**
   - After 30 days, move raw uploads from cold storage to archival storage.
   - Option to permanently delete raw uploads after a configurable retention period (e.g., 1 year).

2. **Processed Video Lifecycle:**
   - After 90 days of inactivity, move processed videos to reduced redundancy or cold storage.
   - Maintain metadata and thumbnails in active storage for fast catalog browsing.

### Backup and Redundancy

1. Enable cross-region replication to protect against regional outages.
2. Schedule periodic backups of metadata and thumbnails.
3. Use versioning for critical files to enable rollback in case of accidental deletion.

## Architecture Overview

1. **File Upload:**
   - Videos uploaded by users are temporarily stored in a staging area before being moved to raw storage.

2. **Storage Processing Pipeline:**
   - After transcoding, processed videos are stored in hot storage and linked to the video catalog.

3. **Data Access:**
   - A secure API layer allows authorized services and users to retrieve video files.

### Example Flow:
1. User uploads a video file.
2. Raw video is stored in cold storage.
3. Transcoding service processes the file into multiple resolutions.
4. Processed files are stored in hot storage for streaming.
5. Lifecycle policies automatically migrate files to cheaper tiers as needed.

## Key Considerations

1. **Cost Management:**
   - Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering or equivalent to dynamically move files between tiers based on access patterns.
   - Set quotas to control storage growth.

2. **Security:**
   - Encrypt all files at rest and in transit.
   - Use signed URLs for temporary access to private files.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement monitoring for storage usage, lifecycle transitions, and failed accesses.
   - Configure alerts for unexpected growth in storage or high request rates.

4. **Compliance:**
   - Ensure the system complies with GDPR, CCPA, or other relevant privacy regulations for family data.

## Success Metrics

1. **Storage Utilization:**
   - Average utilization of hot and cold storage tiers does not exceed 80%.
2. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - Lifecycle policies reduce storage costs by at least 30% over a 12-month period.
3. **Availability:**
   - Processed videos have 99.9% availability for streaming.
4. **User Satisfaction:**
   - Users can upload, store, and retrieve videos without noticeable delays or errors.

## Conclusion

The storage system is a critical component of the family streaming service. By implementing scalable storage tiers, robust lifecycle policies, and secure access controls, the system will balance performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency. This document serves as a foundation for developing and deploying the storage solution.
